## Technical Implementation

The PDF export uses the jsPDF library with the autoTable plugin to generate well-formatted documents. The implementation includes:

1. **Multi-page Layout**: Automatically creates new pages as needed
2. **Responsive Tables**: Adapts table columns to content length
3. **Text Wrapping**: Handles long text fields appropriately
4. **Page Numbering**: Adds page numbers to all pages
5. **Headers/Footers**: Consistent elements across all pages
6. **Styling**: Professional appearance with appropriate fonts and colors

## Usage

To export compliance data as PDF:

1. Navigate to the dashboard or document analysis page
2. Locate the Export button (typically near the top-right of the page)
3. Click the Export button to open the format selection menu
4. Select "PDF Report" from the options
5. The PDF will automatically download with a filename based on the document name and current date

The exported PDF will contain all the compliance analysis data in a professionally formatted report suitable for sharing with stakeholders, auditors, or for archival purposes.
